# File Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains scripts to encrypt and decrypt files using the `cryptography.fernet` module in Python.

## Files

- `voldemart.py`: Script to encrypt files.
- `decrypt.py`: Script to decrypt files.
- `thekey.key`: The key file used for encryption and decryption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` module

You can install the `cryptography` module using pip:
```sh
pip install cryptography
```

## Usage

### Encryption

To encrypt files, run the `voldemart.py` script:
```sh
python3 voldemart.py
```

### Decryption

To decrypt files, run the `decrypt.py` script:
```sh
python3 decrypt.py
```

### Important Note and Precautions

1. **Key Management**: 
   - Keep `thekey.key` secure and backed up. Losing this key will make encrypted files permanently inaccessible.
   - Do not share `thekey.key` publicly or commit it to source control.

2. **Avoid Re-encryption Issues**: 
   - Running `voldemart.py` multiple times will generate a new key each time unless `thekey.key` already exists. This will prevent decrypting files encrypted with previous keys.

3. **Backup Encrypted Files**: 
   - Always keep backups of important encrypted files in case of accidental deletion or corruption.

4. **Testing**: 
   - Before encrypting important files, test the decryption process with test files to ensure everything works as expected.

### Solution

To ensure the same key is used for encryption:

1. **Modify `voldemart.py`**: 
   - Check for the existence of `thekey.key` before generating a new key:
   
   ```python
   # Check if the key already exists
   if not os.path.exists("thekey.key"):
       # Generate a new key if it doesn't exist
       key = Fernet.generate_key()
       with open("thekey.key", "wb") as key_file:
           key_file.write(key)
   else:
       # Use the existing key
       with open("thekey.key", "rb") as key_file:
           key = key_file.read()
   ```

2. **Ensure Secure Handling**: 
   - Implement secure practices for handling encryption keys, especially in production or sensitive environments.
